# Fee Markets

Blockchains promise decentralized access to computing, but high transaction fees limit adoption. As a result, many blockchain applications have been restricted to the ‘golden billion’ who can afford double-digit fees for a simple transaction. 

Solana, a popular blockchain network, is testing a new transaction fee design. Instead of global fee markets, Solana will create application-specific markets. However, a fundamental causal question must be answered. **Do local fee markets cause lower transaction fees?**

This repository will provide a visual exploration of this question.
